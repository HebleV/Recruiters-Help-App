# Recruiters-Help-App
This is just a frontend design for a simple recruiter help app.
There are 3 tabs : Mail Us, FAQ, Live Chat.
Every tab has different content and different functions

Design problem :
————————————————
Let’s say we want to build a unified help widget for our SaaS product, which has these three options(design mockups are attached in the zip) : 
- Chat with a support agent 
- Write an email to support 
- Find the answer from help articles
    
Assumptions : 
—————————————
 - Assume the “Live Chat” tab will be handled by some chat provider like Olark, so you could render some dummy content when a user switches to that tab. 
 - For the thumbnail icons in “FAQ” tab, you can use some placeholder icons (from Font Awesome, etc).
